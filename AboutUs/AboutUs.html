<h2 class="padding">Our Group</h2>
<p class="padding">We may be small but we are very dedicated to our work. We currently own three RDA horses and have the use of two more during our sessions, thanks to their generous owners.</P>

 <p class="padding">We currently run two sessions per week (Saturday and Wednesdays) with up to 15 participants per session. None of this would be possible without our amazing team of volunteers who donate thier time to us every week.</p>

 <p class="padding">We have three fully qualified coaches who will coach each session with the help of trainee coaches, team leaders and volunteers.</p>
