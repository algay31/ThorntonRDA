<h2>I Saw A Child</h2>
<pre>
I saw a child who couldn't walk,
sit on a horse, laugh and talk.
Then ride it through a field of daisies
and yet he couldn't walk unaided.

I saw a child, no legs below,
sit on a horse, and make it go,
through the woods of green
and places he had never been
to sit and stare, except from a chair.

I saw a child who could only crawl,
mount a horse and sit up tall.
Put it through degrees of paces
and laugh at the wonder in our faces.

I saw a child born into strife,
take up and hold the reins of life
and that same child was heard to say
"Thank God for showing me the wayâ€¦."
